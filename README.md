# Reachy_Project
Trying to do a working Reachy Robot in Unity using the python sdk.
The final project is to use the Reachy robot to immitate the human movement.


Now, we have a functionning simulated camera for the robot and we have integrated the webcam into the 3D world so the robot can see it.


The robot can now produce movement with indications in the script. And can mostly reproduce the movement of raising his arm
